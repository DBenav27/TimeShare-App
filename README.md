# TimeShare App

*The TimeShare app allows users to add significant life events to a timeline. Users can view, add, edit, and remove any of their own posts on their timeline. Each user's timeline is unique to their user id (created upon signup through Firebase Auth).*

[TimeShare hosted on Heroku](https://timeshare-atx.herokuapp.com/)
